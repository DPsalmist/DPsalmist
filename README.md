## 👋 Hi, I'm Damilare Samuel

I'm a **Senior Python Developer**, **AI/ML Engineer**, and **STEM Educator** passionate about using logic and reusable codes to solve real-world problems and empower others through knowledge-sharing.

With 5+ years of experience building scalable backends and developing machine learning solutions, I specialize in:

- 🧠 **Machine Learning & AI** – classification, regression, deep learning, academic & applied research
- 🛠️ **Python Development** – Django, Flask, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, REST APIs
- 📊 **Data Science** – Pandas, NumPy, SQL, data preprocessing, data visualization
- ☁️ **Deployment & Infrastructure** – Docker, AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, Railway, Git & GitHub Actions

I've built and contributed to projects in healthcare, education, and business domains — including intelligent forecasting systems, AI-powered tools, and web-based applications.

Currently, I'm building **StockSmartAI**, a time series-based inventory forecasting system to help businesses reduce stockouts and improve demand planning (exploring Facebook Prophet + PyTorch).

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science and have a background in teaching STEM subjects for 7+ years — now channeling that passion into mentoring new tech professionals and writing about AI.
